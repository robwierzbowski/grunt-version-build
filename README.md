# grunt-branch-portal

> Create and manage 'portal' branches that contain only subdirectories of your main branch. Useful for publishing built code to Github Pages.

## Getting started

This plugin requires [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) `~0.4.0` and [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide which explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process you may install this plugin with the command:

```shell
npm install grunt-branch-portal --save-dev
```

After the plugin has been installed, load it in your Gruntfile with:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-branch-portal');
```

### Setting up .gitignore

<!-- // one time setup
Must manually add dist dir to app gitignore.
If desired, must manually create new gitignore in app, to be copied to dist.
 -->

## Branch_portal task

_Run this task with the `grunt branch_portal` command._

This task helps you version and deploy your project's built code alongside your project's source code. 

The grunt task can commit, generates automated commit messages, and push the branches containing built code to your source code repo or to a remote repositiory for deployment.

<!-- - This is not a general node git tool. Use grunt-git-xxxwhatever for that
- Preserves commit history in non-local branch
- Works with clean and build task, or as part of build task. 
- can be the same dir for multiple portal branches
- works with existing branches, won't overwrite previous cm history 
 -->
